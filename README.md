LYQL is a tool for achieving real-time, free stock prices. By modifying this code, you should be able to scrape any type of data. Currently, this is achieved by the Server application keeping track of requested ticker symbols and users connected over Socket.io. Users are added to channels determined by their requested ticker symbols.
